Potato
======

An ugly HTML5 game

This is the the source of the game "Potato" on GameJolt.com: http://gamejolt.com/games/arcade/potato/38906/

This is horrible, but has proven to be verrrry educational to myself; teaches how not to code really: I don't have one real class, I have a lot of globals, nothing object oriented. So please, don't laugh :)
(You probably won't laugh as your eyes explode if you do actually look at the code)
